### Project - Codecademy [Build Web APIs From Scratch](https://www.codecademy.com/pro/intensive/build-web-apis-from-scratch) intensive

This app utilizes Express to implement the REST API for a web-based internal tool for the fictitious coffee shop Expresso.  
The API provides CRUD logic for employees, employee timesheets, menus, and menu items in a SQLite database.

To execute on your local machine:
1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
2. Run `node migration.js` to set up the database
3. (Optional) Run `node seed.js` to populate the database with sample data
4. Run `node server.js` to start the API server
5. Open `index.html` in your web browser to launch the application

Additionally, a Mocha/Chai test suite is included, run `npm test` to execute.
